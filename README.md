# Proxy Checker Script  
    
  This script is designed to help users check the status of free proxies by scraping a list of proxies from a website, testing each one using the ProxyChecker module, and then saving the results of the working proxies as a CSV file.  
## Dependencies  
    
  This script uses three external libraries: `requests`, `pandas`, and `proxy_checker`. You can install these libraries using pip.  
  
  ```
  pip install requests pandas proxy_checker
  ```
## How to use the script  
    
  To use the script, simply run it in a Python environment. The script will automatically scrape the website "[https://free-proxy-list.net/](https://free-proxy-list.net/)" to get a list of free proxies. Then it will test each proxy in the list using the ProxyChecker module.  
    
  The working proxies will be saved in a CSV file named "working_proxies.csv". This file will contain two columns: "connection" and "details". The "connection" column lists the IP address and port number of each working proxy, while the "details" column lists information about each proxy, such as the country where the proxy is located, the anonymity level of the proxy, and whether the proxy supports HTTPS.  
    
  The script will print out the status of each proxy as it is tested. If a proxy is working, the script will print out the details of the proxy. If a proxy is not working, the script will print out a message saying that the proxy is not working.  
    
  Note that testing all proxies may take some time, depending on the number of proxies in the list. The script will print out a progress message after each proxy is tested, so you can monitor its progress.
